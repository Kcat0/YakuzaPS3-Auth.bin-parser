# YakuzaPS3-Auth.bin-parser

A Python-based parser for extracting and injecting text into "Auth.bin" files used in **cutscenes** of *Yakuza Dead Souls*. This tool is intended to assist with fan translations by allowing basic text editing and reinsertion.

## Disclaimer

- This tool is **not a 100% safe extractor**. It only:
  - Replaces text
  - Adjusts string padding
  - Updates start/end pointers

- It is **highly recommended** to manually test and verify the output file in-game after injection.

## Tested on

-  Confirmed working with *Yakuza Dead Souls (PS3)*
-  May require adaptation for other games in the series
